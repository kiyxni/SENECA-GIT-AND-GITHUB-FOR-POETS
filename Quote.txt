But when you are looking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as you trust yourself, 
you are making a grave mistake,
and have failed to grasp sufficiently the full force of true friendship.

- Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

Nothing, however, delights the mind as much as loving and loyal friendship. 

— Seneca, Letters from a Stoic


There’s nothing worse than a wolf befriending sheep. 
Avoid false friendship at all costs. 
If you are good, straightforward, and well meaning, it should show in your eyes and not escape notice.

— Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
