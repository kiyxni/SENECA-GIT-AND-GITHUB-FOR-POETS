But when you are looking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as you trust yourself, 
you are making a grave mistake,
and have failed to grasp sufficiently the full force of true friendship.

- Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

Nothing, however, delights the mind as much as loving and loyal friendship. 

— Seneca, Letters from a Stoic


There’s nothing worse than a wolf befriending sheep. 
Avoid false friendship at all costs. 
If you are good, straightforward, and well meaning, it should show in your eyes and not escape notice.

— Marcus Aurelius, Meditations


It is characteristic of the social animal to perceive that he is working in a social manner, and to wish his friend should perceive it

- Marcus Aurelius


Above all, keep a close watch on this — that you are never so tied to your former acquaintances and friends that you are pulled down to their level. 
If you don’t, you’ll be ruined. . . . 
You must choose whether to be loved by these friends and remain the same person, or to become a better person at the cost of those friends . . . 
if you try to have it both ways you will neither make progress nor keep what you once had.

— Epictetus, Discourses
